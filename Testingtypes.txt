Automation Testing Types:
********** ******* ******
Below are the different types of automation testing:

Unit testing: Unit testing is the process where you test the smallest functional unit of code.

Integration testing: Verifies the interactions and data flow between integrated modules or components.

Smoke testing: Smoke testing is a type of software testing that determines whether the built software is
stable or not. The smoke testing is done to verify if the most critical functionalities of the software are working as expected.

Performance testing: Performance testing is used to test the speed, response time, stability, and resource usage under various load conditions.

Regression testing: Regression testing is a type of software testing that confirms that previously developed software still works
fine after the change and that the change has not adversely affected existing features.

Sanity Testing:
A subset of regression testing, focusing on a small portion of the system to ensure recent changes haven't broken core functionality.
 To verify that minor changes or bug fixes haven't introduced new defects.

Security testing: Security testing is a type of software testing that uncovers the risks, and vulnerabilities
in the security mechanism of the software application. It helps an organization to identify the loopholes 
in the security mechanism and take corrective measures to rectify the security gaps.

Acceptance testing: Acceptance testing is the last phase of software testing that is performed after the 
system testing. It helps to determine to what degree the application meets end usersâ€™ approval.

API testing: API testing is a type of software testing that validates the Application Programming Interface(API)
and checks the functionality, security, and reliability of the programming interface.

UI Testing: UI testing is a type of software testing that helps testers ensure that all the fields, buttons, 
and other items on the screen function as desired.
