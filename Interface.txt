Interface :

Set of rules or Contract

an interface is a collection of abstract methods and constants (i.e. static and final fields).
It is used to achieve complete abstraction.

An interface can contain any number of methods.

Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class

On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods

When a class implements an interface, it should implimets all of its methods. 
If a class does not perform all the behaviors of the interface, the class must declare itself as abstract.

 Java does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be 
achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces. 

Note: To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma (see example below).

 we can provide interface methods to the third-party vendors for their implementation.
