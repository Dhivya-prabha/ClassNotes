
Parameterization - TestNG

Static - common for all test cases or common among all the testcases
Dynamic - Test data (Excel/db)


What kind of data is kept in your excel/db? - testdata


The common things like @before and after methods in super class

to passing the data in dynaic, We have to declare it in super class 
the mechanisam is called @dataProvider

* dataProvider annotation help us to supply test data to @Test

Each row is one set of test data

what kind of application is an excel is?   - > window based application
 
Selenium interact with only web based application it can not interact with 
window based application

Third party open source products to interact with excel 

Apache POI -other kind of office application(stable software, overcome lots of challanges)
Aspose
JavaXL - only xl 


Apache POI - 

* is the product of a Huge enterprise of 'Apache Maven' 

* Maven is one of its product

POI - Poor Obfuscation Implementation


1. GO to the folder and open the file(path/location)
2. Select the sheet(Sheet name/index)
3. You need to iterate over the rows - row count
4. You need col size to iterate over the cells
5. Go to each cell and read the data









invocationcount -  tells how many times TestNG should run a test method
example:

 @Test(invocationCount=5) 
    public void test1() throws InterruptedException { 
        System.out.println("Thread ID: "+Thread.currentThread().getId()); 
    } 

OutPut:

Thread ID: 1
Thread ID: 1
Thread ID: 1
Thread ID: 1
Thread ID: 1

Above method ran 5 times, a single thread will be assigned to run the method one by one..

ThreadPoolSize

threadPoolSize tells the TestNG to run the test method through multiple threads(browser windows). Though 
this attribute is ignored if invocationCount is not specified. 

 @Test(threadPoolSize=3, invocationCount=5) 
    public void test1() throws InterruptedException { 
        System.out.println("Thread ID: "+Thread.currentThread().getId()); 
    } 
}

Above method ran 5 times, but 3 threads(chrome windows) shared the 5 times of test runâ€¦(threads 11, 12 and 13)
