
Junit 4, 3, 2 has less features compared to testNG.

Junit Jupiter 5 has the advanced ad fantastic feature than testNG
If there are 800 testcases, I have to execute those test cases and generate a report 
as a pdf with test desription with proper screenshots. Now think about a memory...

It'll occupy lots of your memeory. Is it a correct idea to create a 800 pdf file 
report and pass it to the client?
But if it is a HTML file report, it will contain all the 800 testcase reports and I ca pass only a single file
That's the reason we are prefer to create a HTML file report


Using Java language we can programmatically create a HTML file, But if i create a HTML file, I have to take care of the 
Look and feel and execution time dispalay time everthing these are all taking too much of tie. 

But someone already created the code base to generate the reports and released that as a open 
source  and that is 100% compatable with the java language. So we are se that open source product 
in our project.


ExtentReport:

     ExtentReports extend = new ExtentReports();
	ExtentSparkReporter spark = new ExtentSparkReporter("./reports/index.html");
	extent.AttachReporter(spark);
