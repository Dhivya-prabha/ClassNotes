Exception Handling in Java:
*It is a mechanism to handle runtime Errors to handle the normal flow of prgram or application.
*Runtime Errors like ClassNotFoundException,IOException,SQLException,RemoteException...


Advantage of using Exception handling:

Line 1;
Line 2;
Line 3;
Line 4;
Line 5;
Line 6;
Line 7;
Line 8;
Line 9;
Line 10;
Line 11;
Line 12;// Error occurs
Line 13;
Line 14;
Line 15;
Line 16;
Line 17;
Line 18;

The Particular error can be handled and execute the rest of the code using Exception Handling
Where as it is not possible in a normal java program without using Exception Handling.

 Hiereachy of Java Exceptions:
                              Throwable
               Exception                                          Error
             ClassNotFound                                  StackOverflow; VirtualMachineError;OutOFmemeoryError
             IOException
             SQLException
             RuntimeException
          --NullPointerException
           --ArithmeticException
           --IndexOutOfBoundException
           -StringIndexOutOfBoundException
           -ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
          

Types OF Exception:
1. Checked Exception - Compile Time: IOException,SQLException...
2. Unchecked Exception - RunTime Exception :-ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException;NullPointerException;ArithmeticException....
3. Error - Irrecoverable :VirtualMachineError;OutOFmemeoryError



Keywords Used in ExceptionHandling:

try: The block where we specify the exception code.try should be followed by carch or finally.
catch: This block handles the Exception.It is mandatory to either have a try block on top of catch or either a finally followed by Catch block.
finally:This block contains of important code to execute the program,even if the exception is handled or not the finally block will be executed.
throw: This keyword is used to throw an Exception
throws: This keyword is used to declare an exception. it doesnt throw exception.[used in Methods]
