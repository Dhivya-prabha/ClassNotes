Rules:
=======
Every Screen -> Single Java class
Every Field -> Single Method
Every Fields behaviour -> Single Method
Every Method should return its landing Page










Test Framework is software, which will enable us to run our tests as needed. There are two most common frameworks:

JUnit
TestNG

Both the framework are used for unit testing. 
TestNG is similar to JUnit with few more additional functionality. 
TestNG provides parallel execution, grouping, parameterization and dependency which are not available in JUnit. 
It also provides reporting in HTML & XML format.

Our choice of test automation framework is TestNG.

-->Both @BeforeClass and @BeforeTest annotations are preferred to assign the Excel file name
--> Page Object Model is a Design Pattern framework
-->Page Object Model can be integrated with Testng, Apache POI and cucumber
-->In the Page Object Model, each method should return the appropriate class
-->Both XSSFWorkbook and HSSFWorkbook class will you use to access the excel file
-->At test case level by adding any annotation that runs before @DataProvider is the appropriate place to assign the Test Data Filename

Multi lingual Application--> will be having locators in the properties files
===========================
-Multiple properties
-keys will be same
-values will be different

indices= {0} ---> It'll restric to fetch only one set of data from excel. Should be given in @dataprovider annnotation

The differences between the Page Factory and Page Object are listed below âˆ’
*** *********** ******* *** **** ******* *** **** ****** *** ****** *****
In Page Factory, the elements are identified by @FindBy, where in Page Object Model, the elements are identified using the By.
Page Factory has the concept of lazy initialization which is absent in Page Object Model.
Page Object Model is a design pattern while the Page Factory is a class available in the Webdriver class which helps to implement the Page Object Model.
In Page Object Model, every object has to be initialized separately, while in the Page Factory, the initElement() method initializes all objects at once.
