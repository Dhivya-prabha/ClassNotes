class:
	Collection of objects
Objects: 
	Real time entity.
	Combination of state and behavior

A=B, B=C, A=? the answer is, A=C

State of an object -> The state or attributes are the built in characteristics of an object. For example, a T.V has the size, colour, model etc.

Behaviour of the object - The behavior of an object are its predefined functions. For example, a T.V. can show picture , change channels, tune for a channel etc. 

Finally, Class is an collection of state and behavior.

In programming, world properties are in the form of attributes and the behaviors are in the form of methods.



If u open a more than one tab in chrome, each tab is an object.
But all the tabs represents Chrome. Object is an representation of a class.

If there are 50 students in a class. And a class teacher wants to pass a message to them. The class teacher does not need to pass the message to each of them separately instead of that, he can ask the class rep to pass the message. So teacher can represent the total class member with a single rep

Object is an instance of a class. Instance means, representation

Method: method is nothing but the operation that an object can perform it define the behavior of object how an object can interact with outside world

properties of one method can used in another method in java?
You can't. Variables defined inside a method are local to that method. If you want to share variables between methods, then you'll need to specify them as member variables of the class.


  
Access Specifiers:
====================
public  - Global Level Access (inside Package (extends,objects) + outside package (extends,objects))

protected - (inside Package (extends,objects) + outside package (extends))

default - Package level access (extends,objects) 

private - Class level access
