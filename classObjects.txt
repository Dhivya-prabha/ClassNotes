If u open a more than one tab in chrome, each tab is an object.
But all the tabs represents Chrome. Object is an representation of a class.

If there are 50 students in a class. And a class teacher wants to pass a message to them. The class teacher does not need to pass the message to each of them separately instead of that, he can ask the class rep to pass the message. So teacher can represent the total class member with a single rep

Object is an instance of a class. Instance means, representation

properties of one method can used in another method in java?
You can't. Variables defined inside a method are local to that method. If you want to share variables between methods, then you'll need to specify them as member variables of the class.
